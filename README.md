# The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to my version of the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project's curriculum. This is a fun and interactive drawing application that you can use right in your browser.

## Features

- **Cute Kawaii Cursor**: To make the drawing experience more enjoyable, I've implemented a custom cute kawaii cursor. This adds a unique and playful touch to the application.

- **Cutesy Feel**: The overall design and interface of the application have been designed to give it a cutesy feel. The colors, buttons, and layout all contribute to this aesthetic.

## How to Use

1. Hover over the grid to start drawing. Your cute kawaii cursor will leave a trail of color behind.
2. Use the buttons at the top of the screen to change the color, clear the grid, or reset to rainbow.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the application.
